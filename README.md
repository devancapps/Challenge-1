# Challenge-1 HTML & CSS
## University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp First Coding Challenge

The first challenge is to add *accessibility features* to a web page using *HTML and CSS.* This entails making sure that the webpage can be used by people with disabilities, such as those who are visual or audio impairment and require assistive technology. 

**To do this, we will need to:**

1. Implement techniques for adding correct semantic structure to our markup,
2. Use appropriate heading elements and labels, and
3. Ensure that all links and form elements are properly labeled. We will also need to
4. Use ARIA (Accessibility Rich Internet Applications) attributes to make sure our website is compatible with various assistive technologies.
